## Cancer recurrency: Chemo VS Non-chemo
Authors on Climent et al. assessed recurrency after chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with negative lymph nodes. The difference in the rate of recurrency after chemotherapy was not found to be significant. In this notebook we are going to replicate that result. For your convenience, the notebook is also availble in PDF format.
### Data
185 patients with lymph nodeâ€“negative breast cancer. Biopsies were selected randomly from a pool of cryopreserved tumors from 1979 to 2000 at the University of Valencia if they complied with the following: a) invasive breast carcinoma of any size; b) mastectomy or surgery with or without ra- diotherapy; c) negative lymph-node d) complete clinical data e) 50% or more tumor cells in sample. Data is public and available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE6448
